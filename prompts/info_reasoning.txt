[1. What are the possible reasons for the failure?,
2. How to solve the problem in the next layer without human intervention?,
3. What information do you already know?,
4. What additional information do you need to solve the task effectively and autonomously?,
5. What information can be acquired from the basic 3D printer without human intervention to identify the cause of failure?,
6. What information can be requires human intervention?,
7. What are the environmental conditions?,
8. What are the controllable parameters that can be changed to solve the failure in the next layer?
9. Based on the observations what are the failure modes you can identify in the ongoing print?
