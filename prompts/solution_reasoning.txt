    "1. What are the possible reasons for the observations and failure in the last layer?",
    "2. Analyze the information and data you already have regarding the documentation, print parameters, and material properties during the failure.",
    "3. Given the current print parameters [given information known] as observed during ,the last layer, what are the best parameters to adjust to solve the failure in the next layer without human intervention?",
    "4. What are the controllable parameters that can be changed to solve the failure in the next layer?",
    "5. How would you solve the problems without human intervention?",
    "6. Break down the problem into smaller parts and identify the most significant ,contributing factors to the failure. Consider aspects such as material properties, print parameters, and potential G-code commands to use.",
    "7. What solution does a human need to perform to solve the problem in the next layer without discarding the print?",
    "8. What solution does the machine need to perform to solve the problem in the next layer without discarding the print?",
   " 9. Provide step-by-step instructions to solve the problem in the next layer without discarding the print or using human intervention.",
    "10. Given the commands specific to the printer, what commands should be used to solve the problem in the next layer without discarding the print?",
    "11. What parameters, when changed, will impact the quality of the 3D print?",
    "12. What should be the correct values for the parameter changes?",
    "13. Are the parameter values like bed temperature, extruder temperature, speed factor, extrusion factor, etc., correct for the given filament type?",
    "14. How can you optimize the cooling settings to improve print quality?",
    "15. How can adjusting the retraction settings help solve the observed failures?",
    "16. What adjustments to the layer height or width could improve print consistency?",
    "17. Based on the observations what is failure modes?",
    "18. Given current parameters values and information known what would be the best values for them so that the problem is solved in the next segment/layer?",
    "19. Are there other parameters to consider? what are those? what should be the values?"
