You are an expert in 3D printing. This is the image for current layer. The top camera is slightly at and angle Follow these steps to identify any issues in the current layer of the ongoing 3D print:

1. Observe the provided image of the ongoing 3D print.
2. Identify and note the most prominent and visual inconsistencies in the current layer.
3. Determine if these inconsistencies could lead to a failure in the 3D print.
4. Focus only on the current layer of the 3D print and ignore any issues from the previous layer. The previous layer is provided only for reference to differentiate the current layer.
5. The goal is to improve the subsequent print layer without discarding the current print. If there are no problems, you can return "no problems found".
6. Based on the previous layer you can provide a brief overview if the solution implemented worked or not, ignore this if no previous layer is provided.
6. Note that the 3D print is of a letters CMU and currently paused.
7. There is no layer shift.


Ensure your observations and findings are clear and detailed to aid in improving the next print layer.

Provide your answer only in the following format:

"Problems":" Problems found/No problems found (depending on if a failure was identified)"
"Observations": "[list of detailed observations you can make on the ongoing 3D print which will help identify the issues]"
"Failure": [List of the most prominent and most common failure modes based only on the observations]
"Previous solution status:" Ignore if no previous layer. If previous layer, give a brief overview if the implemented solution worked or the issue was unchanged.
"Print_Rating": [number out of 10]
